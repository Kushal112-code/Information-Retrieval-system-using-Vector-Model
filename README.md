# 📚 Information Retrieval System using Vector Model  

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements an **Information Retrieval System** using the **Vector Space Model (VSM)** with **TF-IDF weighting** and **Cosine Similarity**.  
It processes a small set of documents and retrieves the most relevant document(s) for a given user query.  

## ⚙️ Features  
- Preprocessing and vocabulary creation  
- Term Frequency (TF) computation  
- Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) calculation  
- TF-IDF vector generation  
- Cosine similarity computation  
- Ranking documents by relevance  

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack  
- **Python 3**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – tabular representation  
- **Math library** – log, sqrt, etc.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. Documents and query are tokenized.  
2. Normalized TF values are computed.  
3. IDF values are calculated for each word.  
4. TF-IDF vectors are generated for documents and query.  
5. Cosine similarity is used to rank document relevance.
