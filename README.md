# Information-Retrieval-system-using-Vector-Model
NLP information retrieval model

📌 Overview
This project implements an Information Retrieval System using the Vector Space Model (VSM) with TF-IDF weighting and Cosine Similarity.
It processes a small set of documents and retrieves the most relevant document(s) for a given user query.

⚙️ Features
Preprocessing and vocabulary creation,
Term Frequency (TF) computation,
Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) calculation,
TF-IDF vector generation,
Cosine similarity computation,
Ranking documents by relevance.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
Python 3,
NumPy – numerical computations,
Pandas – tabular representation,
Math library – log, sqrt, etc.

🚀 How It Works
Documents and query are tokenized.
Normalized TF values are computed.
IDF values are calculated for each word.
TF-IDF vectors are generated for documents and query.
Cosine similarity is used to rank document relevance.
